Repository for my PhD thesis, whose reference is:

* C. Praz, [*Search for B→Kνν decays with a machine learning method at the Belle II experiment*](https://dx.doi.org/10.3204/PUBDB-2022-04919), Ph.D. thesis, DESY, Hamburg, 2022.

The pdf of the thesis can be produced by unzipping `figs.zip` and `tables.zip`, and running `make`.
For producing the pdf, you need a distribution for the TeX typesetting system, such as [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/quickinstall.html). A template version of the thesis is available in [this repository](https://github.com/cyrraz/latex-thesis-template).

The main files and folders are:
* `phd_thesis.tex`: main tex file whose purpose is to import all the other tex files;
* `Makefile`: makefile to produce the pdf of the thesis;
* `figs.zip`: folder containing the figures;
* `tables.zip`: folder containing the tables;
* `chapters/`: folder containing the tex files of the thesis chapters and appendices;
* `include/packages.tex`: file listing the used packages;
* `include/styles.tex`: file defining the style of the thesis;
