\section{Comparison between the Poisson-based and the Gaussian-based models} \label{sec:pyhf_vs_sghf}
%====================================================================================================

In complement to \cref{fig:signal_injection} in \cref{sec:fit}, \cref{fig:63_data_sghf_vs_pyhf} compares the signal strength $\mu$ obtained by fitting the \pyhf model and the \sghf model to pseudo-observations generated with several input signal strengths $\mu_{\mathrm{sig}}=1,5,20$.
The results are the same for the two models in most cases.

\caption{
Signal strength determined by fitting the \sghf model and the \pyhf model to pseudo-observations.
Pseudo-observations are generated with both Poisson statistical and Gaussian systematic fluctuations around the expectations.
An injected signal strength is varied between $\mu_{\mathrm{sig}}=1$ (standard model expectation), $\mu_{\mathrm{sig}}=5$, and $\mu_{\mathrm{sig}}=20$.
